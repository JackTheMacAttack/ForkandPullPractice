	Will we have the Necessary Rights?
	    Uncertain pedigree: in some cases, it may be difficult to 
         determine if contributions to an open source project are 
         properly licensed by the original author.

	No Warranty or Idmnification
	    Provided "AS IS:" Thus, IBM bears possible risk of infringement 
         upon distribution.

	“Copyleft”, also known as the Viral Effect
	    Improper handling or use of certain OSS code 
         (for example, Affero General Public License (AGPL), 
         GNU General Public License (GPL), or GNU Lesser General 
         Public License (LGPL) code) with or within IBM proprietary 
         code may necessitate that IBM distribute our proprietary
         source code under the terms of licenses, such as the AGPL, 
         GPL, or LGPL.

	Possible relinquishing of IBM’s Intellectual Property rights
	    Some licenses require a patent license grant (competitors
         may be able to use your inventions in their products 
         without paying IBM a licensing fee). Even if not explicit, 
         most licenses are assumed to have implicit grants.  To 
         maintain openness, IBM-approved OSS contributors are 
         encouraged to submit invention disclosures relating to 
         all innovative features.

	Contamination
	    If you view source code and create substantially similar 
         material in the future, that new material could be 
         considered a "copy" and subject to the OSS license terms.
	        Special caution should be taken when looking at GPL 
             (or other "copyleft" licensed) code. Copies of 
             GPL licensed code must be distributed under the GPL 
             license and cannot be relicensed.

	        To the extent the license, for example the BSD license, 
             permits relicensing under a proprietary license, it is not 
             an issue.
