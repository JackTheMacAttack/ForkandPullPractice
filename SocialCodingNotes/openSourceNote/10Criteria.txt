	Free Redistribution
	    The license cannot prevent anyone from selling or giving away the 
        software and cannot impose any royalties or fees on use of 
        the code.
	Source Code
	    The source code must be made available in some well-publicized
         way for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost 
         (preferably downloadable from the Internet without 
         charge but this is not a necessity).

        be distributed under the same terms as the original software 
        license.
	Integrity of Authorâ€™s Source Code
	    The license can restrict source code from being distributed in
         modified form provided it allows the distribution of "patch
          files." The license must allow distribution of software built 
          from modified source code but can require derived works to 
          carry different names or version numbers from the original.

        group of persons.

	    The license must not place restrictions on any other software that is distributed along with the licensed software.
	License Must be Technology-Neutral
	    Accepting the license terms (prior to downloading) must not
         depend on a particular technology.
